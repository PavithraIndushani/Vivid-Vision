    question: "How does solar energy work?",
    answer:
      "Solar energy is harnessed through photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert sunlight into electricity. When sunlight strikes the solar panels, electrons in the cells get excited, creating a flow of direct current (DC). This DC is then converted into alternating current (AC) by an inverter, making it usable to power your home or business.",
